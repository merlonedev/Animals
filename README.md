# Animals
Begginer C# practice with animal kingdom.

In this repository I will practice my skills with C#, as a total beginner, in order to reach higher levels of proficiency with this language.

My goal is to learn to program games with Unity, therefore I must hone my C# skills.

This program consists of a simple console program of an Animal Kingdom, in which a user can add animals with their classes (Mammals, Reptiles etc.) and their species (Cats, Dogs, Eagles etc.).

At the course of my C# learning journey, I will improve the program as needed, adding features such as:

- Creating individual animals (like your own pet, for instance)
- Adding individuals' birthdates and calculating age
- Adding individuals' pet names
- Filtering animals by class or species
- Ordering animals alphabetically (by name, class of species) and/or by age

And whatever other cool features that may help in my learning curve.

I'll appreciate any helps, tips and suggestions, either for this program or for my learning journey!
